# datascience

This is the Data Science course material and lectures.

This course covers several packages that are common to users who use python for scientific data analysis:  NumPy, pandas, and Dask.  NumPy and pandas support analysis of arrays and matrices (including images and time series data),while Dask enables parallelization and aids with handling large data volumes ([perhaps you’ll find this discussion useful](https://towardsdatascience.com/why-every-data-scientist-should-use-dask-81b2b850e15b)).
 
This is a “follow along” class, meaning that you will be working on your computers during the exercises (ideally).  Please try to have your computers set up and ready to go with “Course 0” on https://github.com/helio670/setup
